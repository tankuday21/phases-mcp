## Phase 1 Verification

### Must-Haves
- [x] Dark-mode UI renders with sidebar, toolbar, editor, and preview panes — VERIFIED (Browser test confirmed dark-themed UI with sidebar (NoteFlow logo, search, note list), toolbar, split-pane editor/preview layout. Screenshots show correct rendering.)
- [x] Markdown typed in editor is rendered as HTML in preview in real-time — VERIFIED (Typed '# Hello World', '**bold**', '*italic*', lists, blockquotes, and inline code. All rendered correctly in the preview pane in real-time.)
- [x] Split-pane divider can be dragged to resize editor and preview — VERIFIED (Browser test confirmed drag resize of the split-pane handle works correctly.)
- [x] Note CRUD operations work with localStorage persistence — VERIFIED (Created two notes ('My First Note' and 'Second Note'), switched between them, content correctly persisted. Toast notifications confirmed save operations.)
- [x] Search and tag UI elements are present — VERIFIED (Search input visible in sidebar. Tag input visible in toolbar. Both rendered correctly.)

### Verdict: PASS
